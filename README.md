# Node.js Server Response Timeout

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js applications where a server response is delayed, potentially leading to timeout errors on the client-side.  The `server.js` file contains a simple Express.js server that simulates a 5-second delay before sending a response.  This delay could be caused by various factors such as database queries, external API calls, or computationally intensive operations. The `serverSolution.js` file provides a solution to improve response time and handling of potential issues related to timeouts.

## How to reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd node-server-timeout`
3. Run the server: `node server.js`
4. Make a request to `http://localhost:3000`. Observe that the response takes 5 seconds.

## Solution
The `serverSolution.js` file provides a more robust solution that handles potential timeouts better and improves response time. This solution is designed to inform the client if the response takes too long, preventing the timeout issue.
